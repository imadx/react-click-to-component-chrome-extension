# React Click to Component Extension

![Promo Image](./promo/promo-2.png)

This extension is a simple extension that allows you to click on a component name in a React file and open the file where the component is defined on your editor.

Inspired by [ericclemmons/click-to-component](https://github.com/ericclemmons/click-to-component) and [React Dev Tools](https://react.dev/learn/react-developer-tools)

## Features

- `Option + Click` or `Alt + Click` on a component to open the file in an editor
- Highlight the component name when hovering over it with `Option`/`Alt` key pressed
- Supports Turbopack builds with manually defined project roots (that can be changed simply by updating the localStorage key `clickToReact-projectPath-{HOST}`)
